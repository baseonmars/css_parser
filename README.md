Css Parser
==========

Parses CSS strings into case classes. I'm just playing at the moment.

I'll hopefully keep things generic and make the api a little more enjoyable
to work with. Mostly I want to play with parser combinators and see if there's
some fun to be had extending CSS. (in a similar vein to LESS and SASS, but with
a different usecase in mind.
